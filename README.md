# sort-out
 Inspiration
The worldwide pandemic has made education completely online.  All the assignments, notes and even exams have become online.  Being students, our gallery is full of  notes , handwritten and otherwise. It's  disorganised and messy. There was a need for an app to automatically select and organize the notes for ease of acces.This was the main idea that drove us to come up the app 'Sort-Out'
  What it does
Our app ‘Sort-out’ can automatically separate academic notes, handwritten and otherwise and thus  de-clutter our gallery. It uses machine learning to convert the handwritten notes into editable text formats. It also automatically  categorizes the notes into different topics. The added features that includes a calendar, to-do list and other resources make it a complete student friendly app.
How we built it
Since we are complete beginners to mobile app development, we used figma to design the prototype of the app. Using the help of [FlutLab](https://flutlab.io/) we converted the figma prototype to flutter code. We also built a basic front-end for the website of the app.
This is the front end website of the app.
